[“If a researcher wanted to establish a different between males and females on an intelligence test, is this a; field experiment, quasi experiment, or natural experiment (1 mark)”,“B”,1]
[“What difference does this statements describe ‘in one the participant knows they are being observed, whereas, in the other, the participant does not know’; naturalistic and controlled observations, time sampling and event sampling, overt and covert observations, and participant and non-participant observations (1 mark)”,“C”,1]
[“In a set of data the following values are given, mean = 10, mode = 12 and median = 11. What type of distribution is this; normal distribution, positive skew, or negative skew (1 mark)”,“C”,1]
[“Which of these two statements describes a type two error; when the researcher accepts their experimental hypothesis when they should have rejected it, or when a researcher rejects their experimental hypothesis when they should have accepted it (1 mark)”,“B”,1]
[“A paradigm shift is; when scientists disagree, a shared set of assumptions and methods, when the paradigm shifts from one to another, or when an accepted way of thinking about something is replaced by a new one (1 mark)”,“D”,1]
[“Psychologists sometimes use questionnaires to find out about stress. Outline two strengths of using questionnaires in research (2 marks)”,“The answer should refer to at least two of the following points - can be given to a large sample of people, reduces experimenter bias as the researcher does not need to be present, no special training is required (unlike interviews)”,2]
[“Outline one weakness of using a case study as a method of investigation (2 marks)”,“The answer should refer to at least two of the following points - findings cannot be generalised very easily to others, information gathered is based upon retrospective data which may not be entirely accurate, it is difficult to replicate and this lacks reliability, all case studies are unique situations”,2]
[“What are investigator effects? Suggest one way in which they could be minimised during interviews (3 marks)”,“The answer should refer to at least three of the following points - Investigator effects are any (unintentional) influence of the researcher's behaviour on the participants behaviour, they could use a standardised script, interviews could be trained, ensure all interviewers are of the same gender”,3]
[“Describe the processes and purpose of peer review (6 marks)”,“The answer should refer to at least six of the following points - A psychologist will submit their report for peer review after conducting a study, peer review helps ensure published research has integrity, it is an important part of the scientific process, it features peers who are experts in that particular field of psychology, it is an opportunity to check the validity of the research and make a judgement about the credibility of the design, peers can judge the importance and significance of the research, peers can assess the originality of the work”,6]
[“A researcher used content analysis to investigate how the behaviour of young children changed after they started nursery. She identified a group of 1 year old children. She asked the mother of each child to keep a diary recording the child’s behaviour every day for one week before and one week after the child started nursery. Explain how the researcher could have used content analysis to analyse what the mothers had written (6 marks)”,“The answer should refer to at least six of the following points - Content analysis is a way of analysing data using coding units, create a checklist, identifying suitable coding units, mention examples of coding units - aggression/crying etc, read through the diaries, tally up the behaviours that are listed, compare the tally charts before and after the daycare”,6]
