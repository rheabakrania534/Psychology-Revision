        "question": "Outline the use of anti-anxiety drugs in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (5 marks):",
        "answer": "The answer should refer to at least five of the following points - benzodiazepines are an example of anti-anxiety drugs, they work by enhancing the action of the neurotransmitter GABA and slowing down CNS activity, BZâ€™s mimic GABA and trick the brain into thinking the cells are less active, they react with GABA receptors (on the outside of receiving neurons), GABA locks into these receptors and opens a channel increasing the flow of chloride ions, this makes it harder for neurons to be stimulated by other neurotransmitters, this slows down activity and helps a person feel relaxed",
