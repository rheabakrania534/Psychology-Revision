        "question": "Samanta is digging in the garden, he uses the spade and hits a rock. She immediately stops. Explain how sensory, relay, and motor neurons would function in this situation (6 marks):",
        "answer": "The answer should refer to at least five of the following points - Sensory neurons would send information from the senses to the brain, receptors in her hand would sense the changes and send this information to the CNS, relay neurons (found in the CNS) would decide how to respond to the scenario, these neurons work between the sensory and motor neurons, motor neurons send messages through long axons from the brain to muscles and effectors, this would help her arm muscles to stop digging",

        "question": " Robert complains that his baby is sleeping all day and is awake all night. Using your knowledge of research into exogenous zeitgebers, discuss what Robert could do to encourage his baby to sleep more at night (8 marks):",
        "answer": "The answer should refer to at least eight of the following points - External cues act as exogenous zeitgebers, cues may influence biological rhythms.endogenous pacemakers, light suppresses the production of melatonin (from the pineal gland) which influences the sleep/wake cycle, Robert should attempt to keep his baby in the dark at night and expose his baby to light in the day time, Robert could use social cues to encourage the baby to sleep better (night-time routine), evidence of light as at exogenous zeitgeber - Michael Siffre and the cave or Aschoff and Wever in the WW2 bunker",
