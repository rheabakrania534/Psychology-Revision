        "question": "Discuss findings of research into cultural variations in attachment (8 marks):",
        "answer": "The answer should refer to at least eight of the following points - Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg carried out a meta analysis to investigate cross-cultural variations, the emphasis in collectivist cultures was on group effort and cooperation, collectivist cultures showed high levels of insecure-resistant attachment, the emphasis in individualistic cultures was on personal achievement and independence/privacy, individualistic cultures showed high levels of insecure-avoidant attachment, secure attachment was the most common overall, the sample was greatly biased towards individualistic cultures, study may have been culturally biased as the strange situation was developed in America, the meta-analysis investigated the differences between countries and not cultures",
